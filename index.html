                <p>I've been interested in computers since I was about 10, when my dad first let me play around with his computer. Ever since then, I've made it a point to keep up with the latest trends and updates in the technological world.</p>

                <p>I took my first programming class in <i>scratch</i> when I was in 7th grade. It was just drag and drop code, but it set the foundation for the rest of my coding experience. </p>

                <p>In 11th Grade, I made my first "real" website in my IB Computer Science class. I made it using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that I had learned that year. Scroll farther down to see a screenshot of what it looked like. </p>

            <h2>i18n.com</h2>
            <p>When I was 17, in my IB Computer Science class, I created a website that modeled a computer science forum, where students could ask any  questions they had related to technology. It was mostly modeled after <i>stackoverflow</i>, a popular forum where users submit questions related to tech. </p>
